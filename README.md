# redirector

This is a simple app that generates redirect documents with custom meta tags. I built it to share links from my company's blog on LinkedIn because the platform wasnâ€™t properly pulling screenshots or metadata from the source material. This app allows me to add my own screenshots and metadata for better presentation and sharing.

## Features

* Generate redirect pages with optimized metadata.
* Customize metadata fields like title, description, author, and image.
* Automatically fetch and save images locally from external URLs.
* Easily manage redirects through a CLI tool:
	- Add new redirects.
	- Modify existing redirects.
	- List all redirects in JSON format.
	- Delete redirects.

## Usage

1. **Run the app:** Run using Docker.

	```bash
	docker compose up -d
	```

2. **Manage redirects:** Use the CLI tool to add, modify or delete redirects.

	```bash
	python cli.py
	```
3. **Access Redirects:** Navigate to the route you set up (e.g., https://your-domain.com/my-redirect). The app will render the specified metadata and redirect users to the target URL.
